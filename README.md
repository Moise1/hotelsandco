# Hotels&Co Front-end Development Strategy


This plan considers the front-end revamp of th Hotels&Co the to be the first priority because the back-end will, at a higher percentage, remain the same.So, the front-end and UI/UX teams are the most concerned although the back-end team would be assigned tasks as the need arises.
As the team lead, after discussing with the product owner and the scrum master, we assumed that the project will take 2 months to complete and using the Agile Development Methodology the project will follow the below structure.

* **Phase 1 (a 2-week sprint of the 1st month)**

    * On day 1, the scrum master will call the back-end, front-end, and UI/UX teams in kick-off meeting and let the product owner briefly take the teams through the project at hand and answer the questions from the teams if there are any. On that same day the scrum master and the product owner meet to write user stories for the UI/UX team.

    * The UI/UX team spends the rest of the sprint designing mockups as they receive feedback from the product owner though the daily stand-up meetings.

    * At the end of the sprint, the team will demo its work and get feedback.


* **Phase 2 (a 2-week sprint of the 1 month)**


    * The scrum master and the product owner call the kick-off meeting with the teams and discuss the next steps of the project and hear feedback or questions from the teams.

    * I, the team lead, the scrum master and the product owner work together to product user stories. But more especially, as the team lead, I’m responsible to ensure the best engineering practices, for both the back-end and the front-end team, as adapted by our company such as: 

        * Technologies and tools
        * Test Driven Development
        * CI/CD pipepline tools (Githhub Actions, TravisCI, Jenkins, etc.)
        * Git workflow (creating feature branches, descriptive pull requests, etc.)
        * Code reviews before merging pull requests.
        * Responsiveness (for the UI)


    * The front-end team spends the rest of the sprint implementing the mockup designs, receiving and applying the feedback from the team lead and the product owner that was provided during the daily stand-up meetings.

    * At the end of the sprint, the front-end team demo their work to the product owner and get feedback.

    * Phase 1 (a 2-week sprint of the 2nd month)

    * The scrum master and the team lead call the kick-off meeting with the teams discuss the next steps of the project, see if there’s any work for the back-end team based on what’s required  on the front-end but applicable to the back-end, and hear feedback or concerns from them.

    * If there’s any work for the back-end team, the front-end team pauses their work until the back-end has delivered the required features well-tested and fully functional according to the specified best practices.

    * The front-end team resumes their work, receive and apply feedback from the product owner and the team lead through the daily stand-up meetings. 

    * At the end of the sprint, the team demos their work to the product owner and get feedback.

* **Phase 2 ( a 2-week sprint of the 2nd month)** 

    * The scrum master and the team lead call the kick-off meeting with the teams, review the application of all previously provided feedback, and discuss the next steps of the project and hear feedback or questions from the teams.

    * The front-end team spends the rest of the sprint working on the project and observing all the best practices provided by the team lead.

    * At the of the sprint, the front-end team have a final  demo of the working product for all the parties that were involved in the project from the start, more especially the product owner.
